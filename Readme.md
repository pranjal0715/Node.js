    - **Node.js** is a **runtime environment** that allows you to run **JavaScript on the server-side**. It is built on **Chrome's V8 engine**, uses a **non-blocking, event-driven architecture**, and is ideal for building **scalable and high-performance applications** like APIs, real-time apps, and microservices. ðŸš€
