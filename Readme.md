
# Node.JS
    
    - **Node.js** is a **runtime environment** that allows you to run **JavaScript on the server-side**. It is built on **Chrome's V8 engine**, uses a **non-blocking, event-driven architecture**, and is ideal for building **scalable and high-performance applications** like APIs, real-time apps, and microservices. 

# Why is Node.js Required for Backend Development?

    Node.js is required for the backend because:

    Fast & Scalable 🚀 – Uses non-blocking, event-driven architecture, making it ideal for handling multiple requests simultaneously.
    JavaScript Everywhere 🌍 – Enables full-stack JavaScript development, reducing the need for different languages on the frontend and backend.
    Asynchronous & Non-blocking ⏳ – Handles I/O operations efficiently, making it great for APIs, real-time apps, and databases.
    Lightweight & Efficient ⚡ – Uses a single-threaded model with async processing, reducing resource usage.
    Large Ecosystem (NPM) 📦 – Provides thousands of open-source packages and modules for faster development.
